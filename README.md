This was a project that I worked on my first year Computer engineering course. It was back in 2012.

If you want to read the report that I submitted to the project: 
Although I will warn you, the report is not that good and I suggest you provide a detailed report to your projects if you are going to do so .
This is really a beginner level project one could work on, but its a good place to start. The program, deals with file handling, pointers, arrays and other logical decision control statements. 
I think I used codeBlocks IDE for the project but I could be wrong.
